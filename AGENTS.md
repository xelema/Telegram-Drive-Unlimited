# Repository Agent Instructions

## Behavioral tests are end-to-end only

Use end-to-end regression tests for future work. Do not add or restore unit-test suites, Vitest, Testing Library, inline Rust test modules, or Android JVM unit tests. `npm test` and `test:e2e` in each JavaScript project run the same E2E suite; native journeys run through the dedicated `native_e2e` target. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for commands and coverage boundaries.

Exercise user-visible browser journeys, native child-process/HTTP/storage lifecycles, Worker HTTP requests with local D1, or Android device journeys. Test through application boundaries; renaming an isolated function test to E2E does not meet this policy. External Telegram/PayPal boundaries may use controlled fixtures, but describe that limitation and keep required real-device/sandbox release acceptance.

Preserve account isolation, encrypted-data integrity and recovery, transfer behavior, supporter compatibility, and release protections when changing test coverage. Add the relevant E2E regression before fixing a behavior bug. Keep type checking, formatting, linting, security/dependency/configuration checks, localization checks, bundle budgets, and platform builds. These static checks are separate from behavioral testing and must not be removed as part of an E2E-only policy.

Run `node scripts/check-test-policy.cjs` before handing off testing changes. Never report skipped, unrun, fixture-only, or unavailable device/platform checks as passed. Passing suites are evidence for the exercised journeys, not a guarantee of perfect software.

## Android publication is binaries only

Android project and source files must remain local and must never be committed to or uploaded to GitHub. This includes Android build configuration, native project files, generated project folders, and Android test projects. Only compiled Android binaries may be uploaded, as assets in the separate Android GitHub release. Signing keys and credentials must always remain private.

Local branch merges are allowed; they do not authorize a push or publication of Android project files. Before any future GitHub push, inspect the complete outgoing commits for Android project files, including changes in shared application files. Do not assume that an existing tracked file or a local merge makes Android source eligible for publication.

## $5 lifetime supporter license is a protected compatibility contract

Before changing payments, supporter entitlements, advertisements, release configuration, secure credential storage, or the supporter Cloudflare Worker, read [SUPPORTER_LICENSE_INVARIANTS.md](SUPPORTER_LICENSE_INVARIANTS.md) and [SUPPORTER_SERVICE.md](SUPPORTER_SERVICE.md).

Do not weaken or silently change the established supporter promise:

- one verified payment of exactly $5.00 USD grants the lifetime ad-free supporter entitlement;
- it is not a subscription, and existing purchasers must never be prompted or required to pay again;
- active and offline-grace entitlements must suppress all sponsor advertisements;
- normal application updates must preserve activation;
- recovery-code restoration and the supported device allowance must remain available;
- every application feature remains available to non-paying users;
- backup health must never be used as an entitlement, checkout, refresh, or ad-removal dependency.

Pricing, entitlement rights, device limits, signing-key strategy, stable credential identifiers, token compatibility, revocation policy, or recovery behavior may change only with the repository owner's explicit approval and a reviewed migration plan for existing purchasers. Never rotate the supporter signing key or stable secure-storage identifiers as an incidental refactor.

Any in-scope change must preserve the automated checks listed in `SUPPORTER_LICENSE_INVARIANTS.md`. A live PayPal transaction, production deployment, signing-key rotation, entitlement revocation, or production D1 mutation requires explicit authorization; do not infer it from a general implementation request.
